# Community event calendar

The goal of this project is to list all our awesome community virtual events like TwitterSpaces, Live Streams all in one place so we do not miss any events and also do not have clashes!

## Adding your event

To add your virtual event to the calendar, please create a `json` file in the `public/data` directory.

Here is an example file...

**TYPES** currently supports `youtube`, `twitter`, `discord`.
**TIMEZONES** make sure you add the timezone to the `start` and `end` fields., then the browser will adjust the time to the timezone of the event.

```json
{
  "type": "youtube",
  "author": {
    "name": "Eddie Jaoude",
    "url": "http://github.com/eddiejaoude"
  },
  "url": "http://twitter.com/eddiejaoude",
  "title": "Awesome LIVE stream on stuff",
  "start": "2021-11-20T15:00:00+00:00",
  "end": "2021-11-20T16:00:00+00:00",
  "description": "We will use ReactJS to build a community calendar for all our virtual geek out sessions"
}
```
